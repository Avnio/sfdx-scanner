## Prerequisites

Before you get started, install the required software on your computer.

## Java Platform, Standard Edition Development Kit

Some features in Salesforce Extensions for VS Code depend on the Java Platform, Standard Edition Development Kit (JDK). Install either version 8 or version 11 of the JDK.

If you don’t already have version 8 or 11 of the JDK installed, see the [instructions on how to install and configure Java](./en/getting-started/java-setup).

## Salesforce CLI

Use the Salesforce CLI to execute commands against Salesforce orgs and work with source files on your local computer. Salesforce Extensions for VS Code uses Salesforce CLI behind the scenes, so even if you don’t want to use the CLI directly you must install it on your machine.

For information about installing Salesforce CLI, see the _[Salesforce DX Setup Guide](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.sfdx_setup.meta/sfdx_setup/sfdx_setup_install_cli.htm)_.
