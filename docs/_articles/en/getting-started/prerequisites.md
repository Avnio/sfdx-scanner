## Prerequisites

Before you get started, install the following required software on your computer.

## Java Platform, Standard Edition Development Kit

Some features in Salesforce Extensions for VS Code depend upon the Java Platform, Standard Edition Development Kit (JDK). You need to have either version 8 or version 11 of the JDK installed.

If you don’t already have version 11 or 8 of the JDK installed, see the [instructions on how to install and configure Java](./en/getting-started/java-setup).

## Salesforce CLI

Salesforce CLI is used to execute commands against Salesforce orgs and work with source files on your local machine. Salesforce Extensions for VS Code uses Salesforce CLI behind the scenes, so even if you don’t want to use the CLI directly you need to install it on your machine.

For information about installing Salesforce CLI, see the _[Salesforce DX Setup Guide](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.sfdx_setup.meta/sfdx_setup/sfdx_setup_install_cli.htm)_.
