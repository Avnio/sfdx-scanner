## Salesforce CLI Scanner Plug-in

The Salesforce CLI Scanner plug-in is a unified tool for static analysis of source code, in multiple languages (including Apex), with a consistent command-line interface and report output. We currently support the [PMD rule engine](https://pmd.github.io/) and [ESLint](https://eslint.org/). We may add support for more rule engines in the future.

The Salesforce CLI Scanner Plug-in creates "Rule Violations" when the scanner identifies issues. Developers use this information as feedback to fix their code. 

You can integrate this plug-in into your CI/CD solution to enforce the rules and expect high-quality code.
